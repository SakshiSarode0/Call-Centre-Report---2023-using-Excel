# Call-Centre-Report---2023-Using Advanced Excel

Developed a dynamic Call Centre Performance Dashboard in Microsoft Excel to streamline reporting and enhance decision-making.

Situation: The call center lacked a unified reporting system to track KPIs such as call volume, revenue, and agent effectiveness.

Task: Build an interactive Excel dashboard to visually summarize and analyze key performance metrics across multiple dimensions.

Action: Utilized advanced Excel features including pivot tables, conditional formatting, charts, and slicers to display call trends, representative-wise performance, gender-based caller analysis, and revenue breakdown. Enabled filtering by region, time, and rep.

Result: Delivered a user-friendly tool that improved leadership visibility into team performance, highlighted top agents (e.g., Heena Sheikh with 19% of calls), and supported data-driven decisionsâ€”reducing manual reporting time by 60%.
